## Install

```
npm install -g covgen
```

## Usage

And then in your new projects:

```
covgen <your_email_address>
```

Generates the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) inside the current directory.

Warning! Just copy and pasting a code of conduct isn't a fix. You have to live by it.

I've made this project because the Contributor Covenant is a really good Code of Conduct to use as a standard and if you've read and will abide by it, it's a good default to include in your project.

The code of conduct in this repository was generated with covenant generator.
